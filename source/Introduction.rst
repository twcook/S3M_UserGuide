Using the tutorials
There are some great things about notebooks and some drawbacks. It is important to realize that using S3Model in a notebook is not the recommended approach. You should write an appropriate application to build a model and accept the input data.

When executing the tutorials, you must always run the cells in the sequence from top to bottom. Anything else is precarious. If you want to experiment with changing values in a cell, then be sure to use the Cell->Run All Above option from the menu.

Getting Started with S3Model
For a glossary of terms and abbreviations see the ontology lesson.

Each notebook will guide you through a logical sequence for you to become familiar with S3Model components and how to use the library in your applications to build semantically rich, coherent data models.

For complete details (attribute types, cardinality, etc.) of each model component see the official reference model documentation specifically the technical documentation.

This tutorial provides only an introduction.

To become fully versed in the details and use of S3Model consider taking the advanced course and purchasing the book Data Modeling for Artificial General Intelligence; An Infotropic Approach. (Publication Date: 2019-03-31)

The Kunteksto course will give you a foundation in moving existing data to the S3Model platform. This tool can be used in a pipeline so that you can start with S3Model today; no rip & replace is required. Kunteksto is open source and available from PyPi.

The Infotropic Tools course includes six months of free access to the online Infotropic Tools (ITT) Suite. The ITT Suite provides enhanced modeling and re-usability capability without the need to write code.
