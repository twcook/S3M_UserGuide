    "The instances of these classes express constraints on those **RM** classes. These constraints define a specific model that is identified by a *collision-resistant unique identifier* (CUID). Once defined, these models are immutable under the guidelines of the S3Model specifications. Since shareability is a cornerstone of the S3Model approach these models can be serialized to an XML Schema (including the semantics expressed as RDF/XML) making them easily shareable across all platforms. In the tutorials we visualize serialing the model components as XML Schema complexTypes. You do not need these to use the Python implementation but they are used internally for validation and conformance with the **RM**. \n",
